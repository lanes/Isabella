                        <strong>The Product</strong><br /><br />
                        <p> We got a recent shipment of Kaffe Fassett&lsquo;s Shot Cotton, and the deep hues made me think autumn. Shot cotton is special because the warp and weft yarns are 2 different colors woven together to create a special depth, a &lsquo;shot&lsquo; of color. When the edge of this fabric ravels, you can see a bright contrast to the body of the fabric.</p>
                        
                        <strong>The Creator</strong><br /><br />
